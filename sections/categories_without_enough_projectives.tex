\section{Categories Without Enough Projectives}


\begin{example}
  The category~$\Acat$ of finite abelian groups does not have any projective object aside from~$0$:
  For every~$n \neq 1$ the short exact sequence
  \[
    0
    \to
    \Integer/n
    \to
    \Integer/n^2
    \to
    \Integer/n
    \to
    0
  \]
  does not split, which shows that~$\Integer/n$ is not projective.
  Every finite abelian group is (up to isomorphism) of the form
  \[
      (\Integer/n_1)^{\oplus a_1}
      \oplus
      \dotsb
      \oplus
      (\Integer/n_r)^{\oplus a_r}
  \]
  for some~$n_i \neq 0$ and~$a_i \geq 0$, and hence also not projective by part~\ref*{direct summand of projective} of \cref{more on projectives and injectives} (aside for the trivial group~$0$ which admit zero such summand).
\end{example}





\begin{example}
  If~$X$ is a topological space then the category~$\Sheaf(X)$ of sheaves over~$X$ has enough projectives if and only if the topological space~$X$ is Alexandrov (i.e., arbitrary intersections of open subsets are again open).
  (See \cite{shXenoughprojectives} for more details.)
\end{example}
