\section{Injectives in Other Categories}


\begin{example}
  Let~$X$ be a topological space.
  Then the category~$\Sheaf_X(\Ab)$ has enough injectives.
  Let us give a sketch of the poof:
  
  If~$Y$ is another topological space and~$f \colon X \to Y$ is a continuous map, then~$f$ induces a functor
  \[
    f_*
    \colon
    \Sheaf_Y(\Ab)
    \to
    \Sheaf_X(\Ab)  \,,
  \]
  which is given on objects by
  \[
    f_*(\Gs)(U)
    \defined
    \Gs(f^{-1}(U))
  \]
  for every sheaf~$\Gs$ on~$Y$ and every open subset~$U \subseteq X$.
  For the special case~$X = \{\ast\}$ the sheaf~$f_*(\Gs)$ consists of the single abelian group~$\Gs(Y) = \Gamma(Y,\Gs)$.
  
  The functor~$f_*$ admits a left adjoint~$f^* \colon \Sheaf_X(\Ab) \to \Sheaf_Y(\Ab)$, that can be shown to be exact.
  It follows from \cref{adjunctions between abelian categories} that~$f_*$ respects injectives, i.e., that~$f_*(\Is)$ is injective whenever~$\Is$ is injective.
  
  We can for every~$x \in X$ consider the inclusion~$i_x \colon \{x\} \to X$ to get for every sheaf~$\Fs$ on~$X$ an abelian group~$\Fs_x \defined i_x^*(\Fs)$.
  The category~$\Sheaf_{\{x\}}(\Ab) = \Ab$ has enough injectives, whence we have for some injective abelian group~$I_x$ an embedding~$\Fs_x \to I_x$.
  The induced morphism of sheaves~$(i_x)_*(\Fs_x) \to (i_x)_*(I_x)$ is again a monomorphism because~$(i_x)_*$ is left exact (since it is right adjoint) and hence respects kernels.
  Together with the adjunction unit
  \[
    \Fs
    \to
    (i_x)_*( i_x^*(\Fs) )
    =
    (i_x)_*( \Fs_x )
  \]
  we get a natural morphism
  \[
    \Fs
    \to
    (i_x)_*( \Fs_x )
    \to
    (i_x)_*(I_x)  \,.
  \]
  These natural morphisms fit together to form a monomorphism
  \[
    \Fs
    \to
    \prod_{x \in X} (i_x)_*(\Fs_x)  \,.
  \]
  The composition
  \[
    \Fs
    \to
    \prod_{x \in X} (i_x)_*(\Fs_x)
    \to
    \prod_{x \in X} (i_x)_*(I_x)
  \]
  is a monomorphism into the injective object~$\prod_{x \in X} (i_x)_*(I_x)$.
  This shows that~$\Sheaf_X(\Ab)$ has enough injectives.
  
  We can therefore consider for every open subset~$UÂ \subseteq X$ the right derived functors of the section functor~$\Gamma(U, -) \colon \Sheaf_X(\Ab) \to \Ab$, or more generally the right derived functors of the aforementioned functor~$f_* \colon \Sheaf_Y(\Ab) \to \Sheaf_X(\Ab)$.
  The right derived functors~$(\Right^n \Gamma(U,-))(\Fs) \defines \Hl^i(U,\Fs)$ are known%
  \footnote{and feared}
  as \emph{sheaf cohomology}, whereas the derived functors~$(\Right^n f_*)(\Fs)$ are known as the \emph{higher direct image}.
